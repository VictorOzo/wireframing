# wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual blueprint of a website, application, or digital product. It is a simplified, low-fidelity representation of a design that focuses on structure, layout, and functionality rather than aesthetics or detailed visuals. Wireframes typically use basic shapes like boxes, lines, and placeholders to outline where key elements such as buttons, text, images, and navigation will appear.

## Elements of Wireframing
### 1. Layout Structure
The layout structure defines the framework and organization of the wireframe. It outlines how sections like headers, footers, sidebars, and main content areas are arranged.

#### Example:
A responsive e-commerce site might use a grid layout to ensure a consistent structure across devices. The wireframe shows a fixed header for navigation, a central grid for product listings, and a footer with company details and social links.

### 2. Navigation
Navigation refers to menus, links, and other interactive elements that guide users through the product.

#### Example:
A blog might include a top navigation bar with categories like Home, About, Posts, and Contact. A sidebar could include recent posts or search functionality.

### 3. Content Placement
This element involves determining where text, images, videos, and other media will appear. It emphasizes the hierarchy of information.

#### Example:
A landing page wireframe might position the headline and call-to-action (CTA) button prominently above the fold, with supporting images or testimonials placed further down.

### 4. Functionality
Functionality focuses on interactive elements and their expected behavior, such as buttons, forms, sliders, or dropdowns.

#### Example:
A login page might show fields for Username and Password, a Submit button, and a link for "Forgot Password."

## Types of Wireframes

### 1. Low-Fidelity Wireframes
#### Characteristics:
#### Simple and Rough: Focuses on basic layout and structure using placeholders for content (e.g., boxes for images and lines for text).
#### No Visual Details: Does not include colors, typography, or detailed images.
#### Quick to Create: Can be hand-drawn or made using simple digital tools.
### When to Use:
#### Early Design Stages: Ideal for brainstorming and initial discussions.
#### Concept Validation: Helps stakeholders and team members understand the general flow and structure without being distracted by visuals.
#### Iterative Feedback: Quickly adapted based on feedback, minimizing time investment.

### 2. High-Fidelity Wireframes
#### Characteristics:
#### Detailed and Precise: Includes specific visual elements such as fonts, colors, icons, and exact spacing.
#### Interactive Features: May include clickable elements to simulate functionality.
#### Represents Final Design: Closely resembles the finished product in terms of appearance and layout.
### When to Use:
#### Later Design Stages: Used when the structure and flow are finalized and detailed user feedback is required.
#### Stakeholder Presentations: Demonstrates how the final product will look and function.
#### Development Handoff: Serves as a detailed guide for developers, ensuring design specifications are clear.

### The wireframing used here is a high-fidelity wireframe because it is very detailed, it has the colour schemes and patterns and also the flow of the app.
