# wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual blueprint of a website, application, or digital product. It is a simplified, low-fidelity representation of a design that focuses on structure, layout, and functionality rather than aesthetics or detailed visuals. Wireframes typically use basic shapes like boxes, lines, and placeholders to outline where key elements such as buttons, text, images, and navigation will appear.

## Elements of Wireframing
### Layout Structure
The layout structure defines the framework and organization of the wireframe. It outlines how sections like headers, footers, sidebars, and main content areas are arranged.

#### Example:
A responsive e-commerce site might use a grid layout to ensure a consistent structure across devices. The wireframe shows a fixed header for navigation, a central grid for product listings, and a footer with company details and social links.
