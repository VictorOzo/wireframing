# wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual blueprint of a website, application, or digital product. It is a simplified, low-fidelity representation of a design that focuses on structure, layout, and functionality rather than aesthetics or detailed visuals. Wireframes typically use basic shapes like boxes, lines, and placeholders to outline where key elements such as buttons, text, images, and navigation will appear.

## Elements of Wireframing
### 1. Layout Structure
The layout structure defines the framework and organization of the wireframe. It outlines how sections like headers, footers, sidebars, and main content areas are arranged.

#### Example:
A responsive e-commerce site might use a grid layout to ensure a consistent structure across devices. The wireframe shows a fixed header for navigation, a central grid for product listings, and a footer with company details and social links.

### 2. Navigation
Navigation refers to menus, links, and other interactive elements that guide users through the product.

#### Example:
A blog might include a top navigation bar with categories like Home, About, Posts, and Contact. A sidebar could include recent posts or search functionality.

### 3. Content Placement
This element involves determining where text, images, videos, and other media will appear. It emphasizes the hierarchy of information.

#### Example:
A landing page wireframe might position the headline and call-to-action (CTA) button prominently above the fold, with supporting images or testimonials placed further down.

### 4. Functionality
Functionality focuses on interactive elements and their expected behavior, such as buttons, forms, sliders, or dropdowns.

#### Example:
A login page might show fields for Username and Password, a Submit button, and a link for "Forgot Password."
